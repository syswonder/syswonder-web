# History of the Syswonder Open Source Community

## Background and Motivation

The **Syswonder Open Source Community** was established in late 2022
with the goal of promoting the open-source development and construction
of **ubiquitous operating systems**. The community focuses on the design
and application technologies of ubiquitous operating systems for
different application scenarios, and aims to accelerate their adoption
across diverse domains.

With the rapid advancement of information technologies such as
microelectronics, computer systems, artificial intelligence, and
next-generation communication technologies, human society is entering a
new era of **ubiquitous computing**, characterized by deep integration
among humans, machines, and physical objects, and pervasive intelligent
interconnection of everything.  The number of information devices is
expected to reach the trillion scale—primarily driven by massive
deployments of physical-world and edge devices—and new applications
continue to emerge. These trends pose new challenges and requirements
for existing information infrastructure, including chips, operating
systems, networks, and computing platforms.

Researchers at **Peking University** have referred to the new types of
operating systems as **“ubiquitous operating systems.”** They
argue that, due to the strong domain specificity of ubiquitous computing
scenarios, the broad diversity and extreme heterogeneity of ubiquitous
computing resources, and the highly specialized requirements of
different application domains, ubiquitous operating systems will exhibit
pronounced **domain-oriented and application-specific characteristics**.
Therefore, it is necessary to construct different ubiquitous operating
systems for different application models and scenarios. Based on this
understanding, they initiated research on [**XiUOS**](https://xuos.io), 
a ubiquitous operating system targeting industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
scenarios.

From a chip-centric perspective, researchers at the **Institute of
Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences** proposed that, for
broad yet highly diverse and fragmented application markets, pursuing a
general-purpose chip strategy may not be the optimal path. Instead, they
explored the idea of achieving competitive advantages through
**domain-specific chips combined with vertically integrated hardware–
software co-optimization**. They further suggested that the future
development path of the AIoT ecosystem may lie in an alliance centered
on **RISC-V and ubiquitous operating systems**, representing a new
generation of open instruction sets and operating system paradigms.

Researchers at **Tsinghua University** have argued that emerging
application domains will require new forms of specialized operating
systems. One of the key challenges is how to make the development of new
operating systems **as convenient and efficient as application
development**. To address this challenge, they have conducted research
on building operating system kernel frameworks and reusable kernel
components for various architectures and system forms using the Rust
programming language, exploring a path toward **componentized and
customizable operating system kernels**, and developing projects such as
[**ArceOS**](https://github.com/arceos-org/arceos).

Against this backdrop, a group of researchers concerned with system
software—from institutions including **Peking University, Tsinghua
University, the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Zhejiang University, and
Northwestern Polytechnical University**—came together based on shared
interests to establish the **Syswonder Open Source Community**. The
community aims to explore and experimentally validate new types of
operating systems for **in-situ computing scenarios** that require
near-field real-time perception and situational awareness.

Syswonder is a **purely volunteer-driven community** and is not
affiliated with any single institution. Through this approach, we seek
to collaborate with researchers worldwide who share similar interests,
focusing purely on technology itself. At the same time, we hope to
explore an effective new model of research collaboration—one that is
**frontier-oriented, technology-driven, market-neutral, and
outcome-sharing**—working collectively to create technologies and
projects with real industrial impact.
